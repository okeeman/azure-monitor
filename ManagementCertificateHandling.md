The envisaged scenario is that I would supply the user with a certificate (.cer) which they must add to their Azure subscription as a management certificate. I put the certificate private key (.pfx) in the certificate store of the VM hosting my monitoring service and use it to sign all API requests to the user's cloud service. They must provide me with their subscription ID and the name of the service to be monitored. They then browse to the URL of the monitoring service and click the link to test their service.
