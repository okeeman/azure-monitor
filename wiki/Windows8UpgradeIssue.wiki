After doing a clean install of Windows 8 on my local computer the management certificates which had been used successfully on the Windows 7 OS would no longer work when trying to send REST API requests from Azure Doctor running locally. Some of the management certificates were created by me, some by Windows Azure Tools. It is probable that the certificate which wouldn't work was created on the Windows 7 OS. Creating a new self-signed certificate on the Windows 8 OS solved the issue.
