Tried taking out exceptions and console references. Didn't enable !IntelliTrace as some users reported issues with it. Service was working perfectly locally - sending SMS messages as appropriate - but was unhealthy when deployed. !IntelliTrace indicated that the cert was not found even though it was uploaded. 

Managed to get an upload running healthily but it is still not sending SMS messages.
