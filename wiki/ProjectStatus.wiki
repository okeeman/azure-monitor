The project currently consists of an MVC4 application running in Windows Azure which reports the health status of an MVC3 application also running in Windows Azure. 

AJAX is used to provide an auto-refresh feature. A new AJAX request is made every 30 seconds.

If !JavaScript is not present the site displays an error message. It allows health requests to be made by clicking the link but the auto-refresh feature will not work without !JavaScript.

Issues which would improve the project include:
  * Improve the appearance of the User Interface.
  * Allow for multiple instances of the user's cloud service role.
  * Allow for multiple users.
  * Determine what information needs to be stored in the database.
  * Develop the logic as a Web Service which can be called from any client.
  * Deal with security concerns, e.g. secure transmission of sensitive data.
