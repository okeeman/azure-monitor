Visual Studio 2012 Entity Framework creates DbContext classes by default. This creates an incompatibility issue when trying to add a Domain Service Class for property validation persistence after updating the database. When you try to add a Domain Service Class the Entity Framework model is not available as an option. To remedy this, the Entity Framework model must be converted to an ObjectContext model. This is done by going to the entity model, click inside the model window but outside of the objects, in the Properties window change the Code Generation Strategy from None to Default. Delete the two .tt files belonging to the model and rebuild the project. The model will now be available to select when adding the Domain Service Class.
